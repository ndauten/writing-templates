  This is my abstract.  I usually keep these short and too the point
  (around 200-300 words).  You don't have to cite anything -- in fact it
  is considered poor form to cite things in your abstract -- but you do
  need to give the reader an idea about what you did.  It is also a good
  idea to put numbers in your abstract. The key goal of the abstract is to
  locate the general problem
